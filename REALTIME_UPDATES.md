# Real-time Product Count Updates - Production Implementation âœ…

## Summary
Product counts on the Categories page now update automatically without refresh when products are added, edited, or deleted through the admin panel.

## Implementation
- **Global Event System**: Cross-component communication for real-time updates
- **Optimistic Updates**: Instant UI feedback without additional API calls  
- **Smart Cache Management**: Efficient cache invalidation and updates
- **Category Change Handling**: Proper count updates when products move between categories

## Files Modified
1. `components/categories/categories-page.tsx` - Real-time event listeners and optimistic count updates
2. `components/admin/product-management.tsx` - Event emission after product operations  
3. `lib/fast-cache.ts` - Smart cache invalidation with pattern matching
4. `lib/global-events.ts` - Event system (already existed)

## How It Works
- Admin adds/edits/deletes product â†’ Event emitted â†’ Categories page receives event â†’ Count updates instantly
- No page refresh needed
- Console logging only in development mode
- Production-ready with proper error handling

The system is now live and working seamlessly! ðŸš€
